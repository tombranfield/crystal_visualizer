"""
The crystallographic information file (CIF) is the standard archival format
for storing the information of crystal structures.

This module contains the CifReader class that takes a CIF file as input,
and saves the information within that CIF file into a CurrentCrystalData
dataclass for use by the rest of the program.

For more information about CIF files, please see:
