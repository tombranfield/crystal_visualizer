# A class representing a unit cell of the crystal structure
# It has the crystal system, the space group, the setting, and the lattice
# parameters (basis vectors a, b, c, and angles alpha, beta, gamma)
# This info isn't right - I need to restart and respec.
# For instance the symmetry and space group is all important, not the lengths
# and angles.
